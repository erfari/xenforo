MikeR,"On December 29th, 2007 Mike and Suzys had a wonderful wedding.  They had a fantastic time, were very pleased at all their friends and family who came down, and most important of all they got married!   Because any wedding in which that happens is, ultimately, a success. 

As of today, they have yet to receive the wedding photos or videos, so they are going to jump chronologically from the wedding to the Honeymoon.  Screw you Space-Time Continuum!

Now when it comes to photos, Mike has the eagle-eyes of the two.  Suzy doesnt so much have an eagle eye for photos as perhaps a pigeons eye, or a sparrows eye, or better yet a bee hummingbird (the smallest bird in the world weighing in at just .06 oz) eye for it.  So as a result the pictures that you will be seeing are from Mikes Camera vs. Suzys camera at a ratio of 833 to 1.  That is not a joke.  If it were a joke, you would be laughing now.

The Bride and Groom recovered from their wedding shindig for most of the 30th, and they needed it.  By the time noon rolled around they rolled out of bed with it.  They took care of a few last minute minor details  - like packing for a two week trip.  Its not as if thats a lot of stuff, right?






Mikes Mom was nice enough to drive them to the airport





They boarded the plane without too much hassle, and sat back to sleep six straight hours with no interruptions and no waking up on their red-eye flight





Yea . . .  sometimes that happens and sometimes that doesnt.  This was the latter and both of them stumbled off the plane like drunk, sleep-deprived zombies.

The stretch limo that Mike had arranged to pick them up was a nice treat.





It was pretty comfortable, but it was a little disappointing that the bar and most of the gadgets on the side were just for looks and they couldnt actually get a drink in it, but still it was big and roomy and they didnt have to wait for the bus, so that was relaxing after an uncomfortable plane-ride. 

The arrived at the Polynesian Hotel and it was gorgeous.





The scenery and décor just brought a very tropical feeling to the place that was soothing, relaxing, and even a bit exotic.  They are also very glad that they checked into the Honeymoon Suit, because if they didnt get the Honeymoon Suit now, then when could they?

However, the previous occupants hadnt checked out of it yet.  Mike had called before hand and they said the room was not checked out on the 30th, so when they arrived very early on he 31st they should have been able to check in early.  But such was not the case.  So, Mike and Suzy stumbled to the concierge lounge and got their first treat of the day, their Groom and Bride ears:





Suzy liked her ears.  Like, a lot.  Like, a _whole bunch_.  Like, to an unhealthy degree where Mike was wondering if she was going to start showering in her ears and they would dissolve around her leaving nothing but a pile of white goop on her head that she would still refuse to take off.  She never reached that level, but they did end up wearing their ears for the first half of the vacation, so get used to seeing pictures of them wearing  wedding attire with giant rodent ears on it.

That being said, for now doesnt Suzy in her ears look like the cutest most beautiful bride in the whole world that there has ever been ever ever ever ever?



After taking the obligatory picture in front of the Epcot Ball





The Honeymooners went to The Living Seas.  It was very early so they just walked right in because sane people were asleep in their beds.  But not Mike and Suzy.  They were still in Drunk, Sleep-Deprived Zombie mode and chugged along.  The ride had changed to be incorporate Nemo elements into it [The writer originally wrote Emo Elements before correcting it, and the writer giggled when the writer pictured dark-haired fish with eyeliner make-up on.  That is all.]. 

Mike and Suzy especially liked Turtle Talk With Crush.  It was amazing how they did such good animation in real time.  Mike only wishes that he would have thought of his question to ask Crush, We just got married!  Do turtles marry for life? before he left the building but thats just because hes a big ham who wants to star in every act he sees

The aquarium part of the exhibit was pretty interesting;





and of course, it was cool to watch the Nemo fish which were smaller than expected.





It was getting close to lunch time by now so Mike took Suzy over to the Land mainly because he wanted to see how busy their food area was





and to show Suzy how smart he was for making reservations.  Suzy patted Mike on the head and said, Whos a good boy?  Whos a good boy?  And off they went to eat lunch at the Coral Reef Restaurant."
OhMari,"Hi,
Welcome to the DIS.  Can't wait to see your wedding photo's.  I have to beg wedding couples to do WDW trip reports.  Most stay over on the Wedding thread.

You crack me up jumping back and forth from first person to third person reporting.  You dh looks familiar.  Has he ever posted pictures on the DIS?"
theles,Congratulations on the marriage....I can't wait to read more...
IATink,Great start to your report!  Can't wait to read more!
Disneys Billpayer,Congrats to you both. I spent my honeymoon on uncle Walts estate 15 years ago and that is one of the few things I can still remember in vivid detail. Looking forward to hearing more on your stay.
k_reile,i'm on board...can't wait to hear about a 2 week vacation at Disney let a lone a honeymoon. Congratulations on the wedding.
MikeR,"What are the odds that the Coral Reef Restaurant would be packed on New Year’s Eve?

Oh . . . about a 1 in 1 chance.  





As Mike and Suzy were walking up to the restaurants they noticed a guy out front who seemed to be there solely to tell people that they didn’t have any available seats for the entire day.  Luckily Mike had made reservations (“Good boy!  Good boy!”).

Besides the obvious fact that it was New Year’s Eve at fricken Disney World, why was it so busy?  Well, you just can’t beat that view:




Mike and Suzy were given a buzzer and were seated rather quickly on the bottom floor close to the water tank.  They followed their servers recommendations and split an appetizer of crab cakes;





It was an enjoyable dish, with a rich creamy sauce, but nothing to write about.  Only the author just did that, so please ignore the paradox in the previous sentence.   

For their main course they got the Blackened Catfish;





which had a lovely spice and zest to it.  Of the two dishes the catfish was definitely the superior one.  

Being Honeymooners Mike and Suzy were given a free desert of crème brûlée which would be the first of many free deserts that would help insure tighter pants before the end of the vacation;






It was a very nice meal to start of Mike and Suzy’s Honeymoon.  It had the best view of any restaurant they have ever been in and the food was quite a lot better than the raw green beans the author is currently eating for lunch (not a joke – Mmm raw green beans)."

Well, to break out of the third person, this is being written by me, Mike, the ""he"" of Mike and Suzy.  I've posted a bit in the wedding section and a pre-trip report.

Cheers,

As a fellow recent Disneymooner I love all of these TR's, but yours is super cool!

We weren't super crazy about Coral Reef...it was good, but not as good as some other places we went. 

Can't wait to hear more!"

That was basically our thoughts as well.  The view was great, but the food was just OK.  If it wasn't for the view then I would have been displeased."
MikeR,"After lunch Mike and Suzy looked at their watches, and it was still too early to go home to their sweet sweet suite, so they went back to the Land to redeem their Fast passes that they got before lunch.  Now, standing in line to get a ticket to stand in a line doesnt seem like it should work, but it totally does and Mike and Suzy would end up strategizing like Sun Tzu on when and where to use Fast pass, and as a result despite going at an extremely busy time they ended up not waiting very much for the entire trip.  

They got on the ride rather fast with there Fast-pass (hence the name);





The Animatronic portion of it was rather meh inducing, but once they got to the part featuring real, actual plants, it was rather interesting.  They had never seen a Dragon Fruit plant before;





or a brussels sprout plant





or a nine pound lemon plant





And of course the pumpkins shaped like Mickey Mouse were totemo kawaii





Afterwards it was finally time for Mike and Suzy to check into their room so they walked past a waterup (it wasnt a fall because the water wasnt falling) 





and they cooled off in a mist station





and finally they got back to the Polynesian and got into their room.





where they collapsed on the bed and quickly fell asleep."
MikeR,"Mike and Suzy overslept a little bit and had to hurry through the dark to get to Epcot and make it to their reservation on time;





They arrived at Restaurant Marrakesh, and were shocked, shocked, that it was packed on New Year’s Eve;





They were about a half hour late for their reservation, but the receptionist didn’t even comment on it and just told them to wait over there.  At least the architecture was pretty to look at;





It was loud and busy, but time passed as it has a tendency to do, and Mike and Suzy were soon seated and enjoyed a very tasty Moroccan tea;  





The servers were dressed in beautiful Moroccan outfits and were quite helpful in making various recommendations;





Mike and Suzy decided to split an order of Couscous, seasonal vegetables, and a Lamb Shank





It was tasty and filling, but a little fatty.  The couscous went especially well with the Moroccan wine.

As is their want, Mike and Suzy received a free desert of Bastilla - crispy leaves of pastry topped with vanilla cream and sprinkled with toasted almonds;





The restaurant had entertainment throughout Mike and Suzy’s.  They had belly dancing;





Which Mike along with some other tourists tried to learn, failing miserably;





And they had some Moroccan music played on an instrument which the author cannot remember the name of.  Does anyone know what this is?





After they left there was an impromptu dancing by a tourist out in the street





But Suzy refused to join in with that and instead preferred to save her dancing for the solemn dignity that only a stall selling bells can provide;





All in all, Mike and Suzy have eaten at better Moroccan restaurants.  The scenery was very nice, but the food could have been improved upon.  Still, it was a fun place to have their last meal of 2007."
MikeR,"The New Year was fast approaching, so Mike and Suzy began to get their drink on with a quick trip to the Rose & Crown Pub.





Mike got a Strongbow Hard Cider while Suzy got a Guinness.  You may not be able to see it, but there is a 2008 printed on the foam in this drink;





The hard cider was the hit of the night, and both Mike and Suzy ordered a Woodpecker cider and some more Strongbow cider over the next few hours.  They tried to keep their drinking under control as they passed by the Ghost of Hangovers yet to come being wheeled out in a kiddy-stroller;





For a while they watched British Invasion a Beatles cover band.  There was just something nice about sitting in a (fake) British square listening to a (fake) Beatles song while breathing the (fake?) night air.





After the cover band finished their set it was time for Mike and Suzy to find a seat for the Fireworks of Illuminations.  The viewing area was a _little_ crowded;





But Suzy saw a spot on a wall that was completely empty so she encouraged (I.E. told) Mike to get up there and about two seconds after they sat on the wall someone shouted, Youre blocking the VIEW! so Mike and Suzy sheepishly scooted east some only to have another voice shout, Now youre blocking MY view, followed by more scooting and more shouting until Mike and Suzy just got off and hopped into the seats of a restaurant.  They werent sure if they were allowed to do that or not, but no one complained and they ordered drinks so it seems to have worked out well until the area got _really_ crowded (including the wall area that Mike and Suzy were shouted off of!) and they couldnt see anymore as Suzy is a short, short lady.  So they sat on a garbage can which was higher and had a better view than the chairs.  And thats how they brought in the New Year, sitting on garbage and watching the . . .

Fireworks!




And kissing!




And watching more fireworks!




And more kissing!




Once 2008 had begun Mike and Suzy went back to the Rose and Crown and came across the coolest T-shirts in the World.  This group was doing a Drink-Around-The-World-Tour of Epcots World Showcase and some of their members didnt show up;





So Mike and Suzy talked to them for a while, and the group offered to sell them the two spare T-shirts they had for cost.  The reason these T-shirts are so cool is that on the back they have eleven blank circles on the back with the name of all the eleven World Showcase countries on them so that you can write the name of each alcoholic drink you have in its corresponding nations circle with a black sharpie.  That way, you have a record of your drunkitude, which is oh so very important.  Mike and Suzy got stopped over five times on their vacation by various people asking where they could buy their T-shirts, but they were one of a kind artifacts so no go for anyone but Mike and Suzy!

Mike and Suzy went off to France to fill in one of their circles and got some tasty Pomegranate Glow-In-the-Dark Champaign.   





It was a little unusual, and Mike couldnt taste the fruit very well, but it was a nice change of pace from the Hard Ciders they had been drinking.

After they were done drinking, it was time to drink, so they went to the Yakitori House at the Japan pavilion and got some sake as well as some udon noodles.





The Sake would have been undrinkable if they had just started the night, but thankfully their taste buds had been pounded into submission by that point, so they managed to drink half of it.  The Udon noodles were no different than you could get at any cheap and easy Japanese restaurant, but after a long night they went down perfectly.  Soup is one of the worlds most perfect drinking foods.

It was then time to try and burn off the calories of the night (or perhaps .00001% of them) so it was lucky that Mike and Suzy stumbled across a Latin Dance Party at . . . uh . . . Latin Land!





They did not play any Waltzs at the Latin Dance Party (what are the odds?) so they Mike and Suzy did not get a chance to show off their dance skills that they learned for their first dance at their wedding, but they would later on in the Honeymoon.  Instead Mike and Suzy just got down and / or funky with the beat.





Soon though the party closed and the song Closing Time with its not so subtle message of You dont have to go home but you cant stay here, came over the speakers so Mike and Suzy made their way out of the park;





They got lucky and managed to use their Super-Honeymooning Powers to ride in the front of the Monorail, the only time they got a chance to do that on the trip;





They briefly hung out in their lobby;





before heading to their rooms to crash.  It was a great first day of their Honeymoon and they were so happy to be together."
k_reile,"DH and I drank around the world when we were there at the beginning of the F&W festival. We   the pomogrante champagne....so much that we brought the stuff to make them at our own new years eve get together. We certainly had the bill to prove that we had been drinking around the world...but oh well it was really fun and something you cannot do anywhere else!!  Of course when we got home, DH went to buy 2 6 packs of beer and said he felt like he had ripped off the store because both of them cost what one drink cost at WDW! Did you go drinking at Raglan Road?  We did one night at their outdoor bar...that was pretty cool! Love how they put the 2008 in your beer....pretty cool!"
MikeR,"Day 2:  Recuperation

Before he went to sleep Mike put a menu in the bathroom so that when he woke up he could order room service for breakfast without waking up Suzy,





and when the morning came that is exactly what he did;





From Ohana he order some sausage and eggs as well as Tonga Toast.  The eggs and sausage were extremely edible and what you would expect from eggs and sausage.  Tonga Toast, on the other hand, is basically French Toast stuffed with Bananas and it was extremely yummy-licious.   It was so good and different from normal French Toast that Mike is considering cooking it himself next New Years Day as kind of a special Honeymoon-Anniversary-New-Year treat.  It seems like it could be a fun tradition to start.  On the other hand, he is deeply lazy and cooking with a lot of oil after a night known for the imbuement of alcohol might not be the best plan, so we shall see.

Mike and Suzy puttered around the room some more after eating, took a short nap (all that waking up and eating was exhausting) puttered around some more, showered, got dressed and looked into the concierge room to see what type of free goodies they were getting;





Well, not exactly free.  In fact, if you do the math these are some of the most expensive cupcakes you will ever eat.  The concierge room was nice, but Mike and Suzy didnt actually use it that much.  They got so much food on the trip, that they didnt really need any extra food, but what they most got from concierge service was, unsurprisingly, the concierge service; all the help in making reservations, questions answered, etc. 

However, Suzy did quite enjoy the chocolate covered Mickey Mouse Shaped Rice Crispy Treats;



She took a half-dozen of them when we left the room and was very reluctant to throw them away at the end of the trip when they had grown new life forms that evolved into a miniature civilization in the midst of developing masonry.

After that they walked around to explore the Polynesian Hotel and were mooned by a couple wooden statues;









Rather than suffer further abuse at the hands of timber figurines, they took this as a sign that they should get out of the Polynesian.  They didnt want to fight the crowds on New Years Day, so they decided to have a nice easy time of it and explore some of the other hotels on the monorail track.

First they went to the Grand Floridian;





Which has some truly wonderful scenery and an atmosphere of a turn of the century (20th, not 21st)  Floridian retreat;





as well as having the largest Gingerbread House Mike had ever seen;





While there Suzy also took a peak into Victoria & Alberts as a preview of credit card debt yet to come;





They also hung out in a hammock for a bit;





And engaged in a little cross dressing fun;





Next up was the Contemporary Resort;





Which was honestly a bit of a disappointment.  It was essentially a very boxy old architectural building that was supposed to inspire images of the future but left Mike feeling like he had been transported to the far future, all the way to the year 1983! 

Also, they used to have a huge arcade that got moved and seriously downgraded.  Mike actually had fond memories of making his first move on a girl in that arcade back in the early 90s.  That move failed miserably of course, but at least it was made.  Does anyone have any pictures of that old arcade anywhere?

About the most interesting thing in the Contemporary was its life sized chocolate diorama of Pinocchio.  This took 280 pounds of sugar, 255 pounds of Chocolate, 63 pounds of flour, 40 pounds of honey, and 2 pounds of cinnamon to make;





The monorail then took them back to the Polynesians





Where they hung out in their room for a bit.  This might be a good time to show off the Honeymoon suite.  It honestly was not that big, but it was nice and comfortable;





And it had a great bathtub;





And a pretty bathroom floor pattern that Suzy wants to copy someday in their house;



"
MikeR,"Soon enough it was time for the favorite part of any honeymoon, getting leid;





Mike and Suzy had tickets for the Hawaiian Luau.  Mike ordered the best tickets they offered, and while it was closer to the stage than the back row tickets, it honestly did not feel that the tickets were that special as they were still a few rows back.  

The first round of food was appetizers consisting of sweet bread, pineapple, and salad;





And the main course was pork spare ribs, chicken, and rice;



 

With a desert of a chocolate mousse shaped like a volcano;





This food OK, but as was often the case if you are used to eating ethnic food in your home town you might find Disneys version of it to be a bit watered downed and low grade in comparison to what you are used to.  At Mikes old college they had a huge luau every year in which an entire pig was roasted underground, real poi was served, and other Polynesian dishes were prepared.  That was all put on by volunteer college students in their spare time and it was fantastic.  Youd think that Disney could match that, but it wasnt even close.  Thats not to say the food was bad or not enjoyable, just that it could have been better and it wasnt really Polynesian food.

The show itself was cute and funny at times;  





It stared and island girl who came back from the mainland and told of her journey to rediscover her island roots by shaking her moneymakers;





Also it guest-stared fire!





After the show was over Mike and Suzy looked at some paintings for sale in the lobby;





They were pretty, but not worth the cost.  Besides, Mike has already bought enough art work for their house anyways (according to Suzy, Mike begs to differ).  

They then went to downtown Disney on a quest to find a very specific gift for Mikes Mom (A Mickey Mouse watch with an American flag on it.  She works at Veterans Affairs).  





It was a long and arduous quest lasting all of five minutes at the biggest Disney store in the world, 





but they were successful and also had time to check out Goofys Candy Co





Look at some more artwork that Mike was forbidden to buy;





and have Mike pull Suzy aside and point out this sign;





so that he could make the joke of wanting a smoothie flavored like roast beef.  It might have been funnier if he had not so obviously showing the sign to her to just to make the joke.  

With that they returned home and went to sleep."
IATink,I just got caught up on your report!  I love your writing style and the pictures are great.  Sounds like you had a great honeymoon.  Can't wait to read more.
IloveDMB,"Congratulations on your wedding!  Your trip report is cracking me up, you have a great style.

Can't wait to read more."
MikeR,"Day 3:  The Magic Kingdom

Mike and Suzy arrived at the Magic Kingdom before the park opened 





because they had a reservation to eat breakfast at Cinderella’s Palace.  It was a little bizarre to be at a theme park and have it be almost completely empty of people, but they did get a picture of just them and the castle, and how often does that happen?





Mike and Suzy waited in line and got their picture taken with Cinderella;





Then climbed the staircase (NO part of this Honeymoon must be undocumented!);





to attend the breakfast ball.  The food  . . . was nothing special, just standard breakfast fair.  Mike even forgot to take a picture of it (Part of the Honeymoon is undocumented!  Horrors!  Shock!  Alarm!).   But people don’t go to character dinning for the food, do they?  They mainly go for the princesses and there were plenty of those.  First up was Snow White who asked Mike who his favorite princess was.  He didn’t really have one so he thought it would be polite to say that Snow White was his favorite princess, but as soon as he started to answer Snow pointed at Suzy, so Mike quickly said that Suzy was his favorite princess, and she truly is.





Next was Belle;





Then Princess Aurora




And finally Jasmine:





After breakfast was over Mike and Suzy went down but found themselves trapped in the castle because the park had not opened yet so they explored the Bibbity-Bobbity-Boutique 





where Mike’s attempts to have them dress Suzy up in a Jessica Rabbit costume were completely unsuccessful so they basically just sat around being cold for a while until it was finally time for the park to open, Mike and Suzy were in a great spot and got to rush ahead of everyone and be the first people to get to various areas of the Magic Kingdom;

Video Clip.

Mike and Suzy dogged one way, then went another, and finally decided upon going to Pirates of the Caribbean;





Mike thought that the addition of Jack Sparrow and company to the ride worked rather well.  The newly added parts don’t detract from the ride so much as they add another element to it.

After Pirates they rushed over to Splash Mountain, and the lines were still short enough (and the weather cold enough) that they had an entire log to themselves;





In Mike’s Opinion, Splash Mountain has the best animatronics in all of Disneyworld.  





And some great scenery too;





The ride is just a lot of fun, even if you do get a little wet on the coldest day of the year;









Next they went to Big Thunder Mountain;





which Mike has always liked because he gets to pretend that he is Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom.

Perhaps he screamed too much because he soon found himself in the stocks;





But he got out in time to go to the Haunted Manssion;





With its eerie paintings that go up;





or is it the floor that goes down?



"
MikeR,"Despite Mikes many protestations that the song would be stuck in their heads for the next 11.5 days, Suzy wanted to go on Its a Small World, 





so off they went;





The line wasnt too long, and the ride was a lot more fun than Mike remembered it being from when he last went on it as a teenager;





Sometimes you just have to grow old in order to be able to put away childish things, like the fear that you might be enjoying something childish.





It was at this point that Mike and Suzys Fast-Pass planning and early morning attendance began to run out of steam.  Their next Fast-pass wasnt for two hours and the lines for all the good rides had grown long enough that they couldnt just walk into whatever ride they wanted too - oh the travails of vacation.  

So they decided to just wait in Space Mountains line for however long it took.  However long turned out to be around 45 minutes, which was the longest they waited for anything on their vacation.  During that time they tried to watch a TV show (Mad Men) on their I-Pod, but their surroundings were quite noisy and the sound on their split headphones wasnt loud enough and the screen wasnt bright enough.  So all in all, Mikes bright idea to make waiting in line a breeze didnt work out very well.  Oh well.  In the future they learned to just bring magazines with them which were easily foldable and usually readable anywhere anytime.  

Space Mountain itself was pretty fun.  They sat in the back





and it was exciting mainly because the ride was in the dark so they were unsure of what would happen next.  Years ago, Mike was on it one time when there was some type of problem and they had to turn the lights on, and that made Space Mountain just a humdrum rollercoaster to tell the truth.

After the ride Mike was pretty happy to get his picture taken with the creature from Lillo and Stitch as that was the most enjoyable Disney film hes seen in a while;





Then they went and cashed in their Fast Passes for the Winnie the Pooh ride which Mike was happy about as he is a big fan;





It was set up as if you were passing through the book itself;





But outside of the ride was still cold so Suzy was all bundled up, so much so that perhaps she looked a little like Pooh herself.  Any resemblance? 

Suzy



Pooh




It was lunch time so Mike and Suzy went to their reservation at the Liberty Tree Inn;





The place was not jam-packed because if you take out a package of jam there is still enough room to stick a spoon in and scoop out the jam, but good luck trying to do that at the Liberty Tree Inn a day after New Years Day because there was not an millimeter to spare.  Not to worry though, because Mike made reservations and had them confirmed in his handy print-out that he was given by concierge when they checked in, right?

Wrong.  The lady up front explained that Mike did not in fact have a reservation.  Mike pointed at his paper saying, No, really.  He does have a reservation. But it was to no avail.  The receptionist said that Mikes reservation had been canceled months ago.  Mike asked why it showed up on his reservation list that he had been given two days ago.  The lady said she didnt know, but that somebody must have made a mistake.  Mike said that he was very sorry that someone in her company had made a mistake, but he had reservation for lunch and as it would be impossible to get new ones given how busy the park was, he intended to keep them.  The lady said that she was sorry but there was no room.  Mike said that as someone had made a mistake that was effecting him, she should make room.  She said that wasnt possible and seemed to be hinting that Mike should just leave.  Mike went into 2001 mode and kept saying, effectively, Im sorry Dave, I cant do that. over and over again to her various subtle and not-so-subtle hints to go away.  Eventually the receptionist gave up and said shed find Mike and Suzy a table as soon as she could but that it would probably be a half hour to an hour.  Mike said that would be fine and thanked her for her help (always be gracious in victory, it doesnt cost anything).

In about 35 minutes or so, Mike and Suzy were shown to their table and were greeted by a waitress decked in festive attire;





They were both pretty full from breakfast so Mike just had some chili and Suzy just had some clam chowder and they both split a pot of tea;





The clam chowder and chili was soup.  Just regular soup.  Nothing incredible, nothing bad, just average ordinary bowl of soup of the type you could find in any chain restaurant like Applebees or the Olive Garden or Newport Bay.  It was however, hot, and I can not emphasize enough how important that was on this very cold day.

The tea was also hot, and Mike and Suzy got some cups to go to help them brave the harsh frigid tundra that central Florida had become;



"
MikeR,"While braving the frosty Florida winter wonderland to get to their next destination, Mike and Suzy passed some thatch huts in Adventure Land.  






They didn’t learn this at the time, but Disney hired authentic tribal thatch makers to create the Thatch Huts at DW and Disney asked those craftsmen to make the thatch less neat and tidy to make it look more “authentic.  However, the craftsmen refused saying that “neat and tidy” was exactly how you had to make thatch roofs and that if you make it all messy it wouldn’t work and hence it wouldn’t be “authentic.”  Then they told Disney to put that in their four-fingered glove and smoke it.  Or maybe I made up that last part.  Who can tell?  We live in a world of uncertainty. 

Soon Mike and Suzy’s Fast-passes for the Jungle Cruise were up so they walked past all the people waiting over an hour to look at plastic hippos and tried not to smirk.  (Smirk, smirk, smirk.)





The jokes were just as corny as Mike remembered them being, ditto for the scenery;





But some of the animatronics were a little naughtier than he remembered.  Suzy just thinks that he has a dirty mind;





After the ride it was still cold and the weather just refused to change even though it was Mike and Suzy’s Honeymoon and they had specifically requested good weather for their entire trip (Did Disney not get that memo?), so since they were getting tired they decided to walk back to their hotel and take a nap so they would be rested for the night.  They passed some lovely scenery;





And even though Christmas had been over for a week there were still plenty of decorations about;




Mike and Suzy also passed some characters and is it just Mike or is this evil Step-daughter way more hot in real life than she is in the movies?





Come nightfall they were ready to celebrate the three biggest contributions to world Civilization that Ireland has given the world, drinking, drinking, and the author can’t remember the third because the author got drunk.  

It was time for Mike and Suzy to party at Raglan Road; 





They placed was packed as usual:





Good thing that Mike had ADRs, but even with those there was still a wait so Mike and Suzy got another one of those handy buzzer devices and they looked around the Irish shop for a while.  The change from looking at Disney junk that they didn’t need to looking at Irish junk they didn’t need was a fascinating experience, but eventually the buzzer went off and their server greeted them and showed them to their seats:





She was a nice gal and made some excellent suggestions.  The seats were in a rather good location with a good view of the dance floor and an even better view of the upside down Christmas Tree which is apparently some type of Irish tradition;



 

Mike ordered the Scallop Forest appetizer, which is forks of scallops served with a lime dipping sauce.  While it is not that many scallops it is fun to look at and very tasty.  The scallops melt in the mouth;




Suzy got a side of creamed corn which she loved:




For the main course Mike got Keen Eye for the Shepherds Pie.  Mike had never had Shepherds Pie before and while it was OK he is not sure if he’ll feel the need to order it again.  Even with it’s modernized look, it still seemed a little plain for his tastes;




Suzy got It's Not Bleedin' Chowder; which is potatoes, mussels, prawns, scallops in a cream sauce – tasty but again not something they’ll order again; 




They ended with the truly wonderful Ger's Bread & Butter Pudding.  This was a fantastic desert that really made the meal;




The band, Tuskar Rock, was in great form that night and played a number of good old Irish songs as well as a couple of new ones.  Mike got their CD and added it to his driving to work collection:




The band invented all the Newlyweds up to dance, and Mike and Suzy were very happy that it was a slow-ish number so they got to show off their waltzing moves that they learned for their wedding.

Raglan also had traditional Irish dancing:




and it was very fast and entertaining.  Unfortunately Suzy had the bad luck to be in the bathroom each time the dancer came out for her short performance so she never saw it;




The mood of the pub was just really boisterous and excited (and filled with drunk people – I wonder if there could be a connection?).  A cute little girl even got up and (seemingly spontaneously) did a little Irish dance which the crowd loved;





Raglan Road was a fantastic and fun dinning experience for Mike and Suzy.  They considered going back during their trip but with all the other places to go to they just didn’t have time, but if it was in their home town they definitely would have been back by now."
MikeR,"The next day Mike and Suzy had to get up extra early because Mike had arranged a special surprise.  They packed up their swimsuits and took off for Epcot;





When they arrived there they sat in an area off to the side and some other guests came and joined them.  It didn’t take Suzy long to figure out why they were there – the Dolphins in Depth tour!





Their tour guides were very knowledgeable and friendly.  However, because this was a backstage show, Disney forbid the taking of pictures less it spoil the image of a magical land, this remains the most undocumented part of their Honeymoon.  As they were walking to the big tank they passed big pipes, and blocky buildings, and other non-Disney things.  Mike pointed to a big pile of black bags and refuse and said, “Look, garbage!”  One of the tour guides replied, “Yes, but it’s magical garbage!” 

When they arrived at the tank, the sheer size of it was truly amazing.  They got a brief lesson about dolphins, Disney’s conservation efforts, and how the various animals and fishes in the aquarium are taken care of.  It was all quite interesting and fascinating, as was the point in which they had to run through a very cold shaft of the building in their swimsuits to get to another area of the building.

Eventually the main purpose of the tour came, and Mike and Suzy got to get into the dolphin pool.  The water was cold at first but pretty manageable after a while, and soon they didn’t notice it, mainly because they got to play with and interact with (but not swim with) a dolphin!   It was so much fun and a definite high point of the honeymoon.





Afterwards, when the tour was all wound up and they were walking out, did Mike slip out his camera and surreptitiously take a picture of the forbidden underbelly of Disney?  Of course not.  That would have been wrong.





Once out of Epcot they caught a ride to MGM-Studios (as it was called way back then);  





They had time to watch a brief Jedi show;





And talk with some of the street performers, who were a lot of fun and enjoyable to joke around with;





And whose name Mike can’t remember.  If only he had some type of red box with his name written on it in white letters that would let people know who he was, but sadly no such thing exists.





They arrived on time for their reservations at the 50’s Prime Time Café, but still had to wait a while because the place was very busy again.  It was OK though as Mike got to relax in a cool ‘50’s chair;





and check out the 1950’s bar;





Mike had previously had some memorable experiences with the wait-staff interacting with him, and he was looking forward to sharing that with Suzy, but perhaps because they were so busy there really wasn’t anything memorable or zany that happened.  She was nice enough to pose for a picture though:





And the décor really set the mood;





The food was also quite good.  They were still quite full from all the food they had been eating that they split the pot roast which was fantastic.  Each bite was so juicy and moist that the meat just fell apart in his mouth;





They also split a Peanut-Butter and Jelly Milkshake;





Mike found it to be very tasty and worth the 27.3 miles he would have to run to work it off, Suzy though . . . she had another experience.  Mike and Suzy split the milkshake by just pouring the top half of it into Mike’s portion, and Suzy ate the bottom half.  However, in that bottom half Suzy found . . . bits of plastic.  Lots of bits of plastic.  She pulled it out and looked  through them and as far as they could tell it was some type of plastic wrapper.  Needless to say this wigged them out a little and they told the waitress who told the manager who came over and apologized and explained that it was probably a wrapper for some of the food and they were most sorry that it got in their and might we please accept the meal on the house and some free desert in way of an apology?

Mike and Suzy agreed and Suzy got the make your own desert which she had a lot of fun with;





Mike, for desert mind you, got some chicken soup;





The waitress gave him a strange look and interrogated him for a while if he really wanted that, but Mike just wasn’t in the mood for desert so he stuck with his guns and got the chicken soup which was filling and relaxing on this cold day."
IloveDMB,"Yay!  Another update!

Not cool about the plastic in the shake.  I've had that happen with food before at Cheesecake Factory although there they were not very apologetic.  It was like they thought we were lying, even though we showed them the offending plastic.

Sorry for the tangent, great report!"
ldadar,You are an adorable couple. thanks for the great trippie.
IATink,"Just got all caught up today.  Another great installment.  

   I was so excited when we went to the 50's prime time because I had heard so many good things about it, and I also was disappointed in the interaction.  I thought it would be more memorable.  I guess it just depends on the server you get.  Also, gross about the plastic  I'm glad they gave you a free dessert and tried to make it right.  

   Looking forward to your next update!"
MikeR,"Mike and Suzy left the Prime Time Café just in time to catch a parade.  The Army men from Toy Story were out in fine force;





And Luke Skywalker decided to show off his O face;





Which inspired the newlyweds to go off and check out Star Tours.  While walking to the line they happened to pass a pair of metallic vultures who were no doubt trying to get the last bit of gold out of the Star Wars franchise;





The attendant showed them the door to their star ship;





and Mike and Suzy entered and were transported to a galaxy far, far away;





Or they went on a first generation motion ride.  One of the two.  Because honestly, Star Tours was one of the first motion rides out there and it shows.  Mike thinks that if youve been on three motion rides, youve pretty much been on them all and if the ride in question is almost old enough to drink, well . . .   The only thing that makes it a cool ride is that it allows you to remember how you used to imagine yourself in an X-wing fighter.

After the ride Mike started geeking out.  

He geeked here;





He geeked there;





He geeked everywhere;



 

He even got into a trivia contest with this guy at the Star Wars gift shop;





Who, Mike is ashamed to admit, stumped him with the question, What is the difference between a Darth Maul and a Darth Lord?  Does anyone know the answer to that?

Afterwards they went to the Muppets 3-D adventure;





The show was very funny, but Mike might have seen it too many times at this point, because he knew every single joke.  He cant remember the name of someone he meets five minutes later, but he can spout off Statler & Waldorf lines that he hasnt heard in seven years.  Where is the justice in that?





On the way out of the park they passed a pretty cool bird too.  Anyone know what this is?





At this point it was time to check into their new hotel.  They enjoyed staying at the Polynesian very much, but it they didnt really mind moving to the All-Star Movie hotel.  The hotel room was primarily a place to sleep after all, and they were quite busy during the day.  

Suzy was still wearing her ears as they entered the hotel;





Check in took a few minutes but was relatively painless;





And soon they were in their new hotel room;





And Mike picked up a very special gift.  Mike had begged and pleaded and used the Its our Honeymoon! on two or three difference concierge people, but finally he had worked his mojo well enough that he was given two passes to skip to the front of any ride, not just those with fast-pass lanes, but any ride;





VICTORY!"
MikeR,"After a nap that went a little longer than expected Mike and Suzy decided to just take a taxi to save time instead of waiting for the busses.  However, the taxis driver told them that MGM Studios was going to close at the time of our reservation at the Sci-Fi Dine in Theatre.  They hemmed and hawed and weren’t sure what they should do, remembering their reservation earlier mix-up, but in the end they decided to just risk it and go.  Mike and Suzy made the right choice because as it turns out the Sci-Fi Dine In Theatre is open later than the rest of the park.  Good info to know.

The décor was very attention-grabbing, and it is a bit of a hoot to sit in the old cars;





While watching some cheesy clips from the ‘50’s;





Mike and Suzy split a Reuben sandwich:





Which really hit the spot.  Nothing fancy, and nothing you couldn’t eat at a million sandwich shops the world over, but it was satisfying and served in an entertaining environment.  Like many other restaurants at Disney, it’s the mood, not the food.

They also got their now customary free desert;





Which they also split in as cute of a manner as they could;





One of the coolest parts of the night was that after they got out of the restaurant, most of MGM was completely empty.  The Christmas lights were still up so it was very festive;





Some things landed on Mike and Suzy as they were walking around and they were shocked to see that it was snow.  They knew it was cold, but they didn’t have any idea that it was that cold.  They marveled at how this was probably the first time snow had fallen here for decades.  Then they looked up and saw a snow machine.  Oops.  At least it was a memorable moment.

Finally with night at an end the couple stumbled into the arcade at the All Star Movies and dinked around with the games for a while.  They were on their honeymoon so they felt comfortable spending enough money to feed a family in Zimbabwe for a month in order to win tickets for crap that they didn’t want.  The funnest (grammar be damned) game was one where you adjusted the flow of air at a ball and tried to keep it within a green series of lights;





Games capable of doing millions of calculations and what really wowed them was flashing lights and a small air cannon.  Technology is a beautiful thing."
MikeR,"Mike and Suzy got up early the next day to go back to MGM studios.  Transportation didnt take that much longer than it would have taken from the Polynesian, so moving to the new hotel and saving beaucoup bucks was looking pretty good.  They got in and grabbed fast passes for the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, but even though they were pretty early, the wait for their fast passes was still a few hours so they looked around and decided to catch a show;





Mike had been meaning to see the Broadway production of Beautify and the Beast for a while now, but for various reasons he had never gotten around to it.  He was quite happy when he heard that there was a version of it playing at Disney World and looked forward to seeing it.  Even though the Broadway version is a lot longer, has a much bigger cast, and is more adult than the one Mike and Suzy saw, they both have one thing that makes it all worth while.  They both have the Bimbettes:




It was an enjoyable quick show and did have great costumes;




Afterwards they headed over to the Great Movie Ride;




The wait was long enough that they saw every preview for every movie in the waiting room at least once.  Mike has fond memories of seeing those previews for the first time when he was deeply into being a film buff.  Back then, it was fascinating for him to watch previews for movies that had long since come out because back then you really couldnt do that.  Nowadays anyone who wanted to could watch those same previews on you tube or on a DVD extra, but back then, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, it was something you couldnt see unless you were in the film industry.  After the previews were over they got in the in the cart and enjoyed the best animatronics that 1989 had to offer:




When they got off the ride Mike spotted Pizza Planet from Toy Story.  He was very curious to check it, hoping that it would be an uber-version of Chuck-E-Cheese with originally games to play that would woosh him away to a different time and space, but such was not the case.  It was just a standard fast food pizza joint.  Shrug:




Suzy passed by a fountain on the way to the ride, and Mike continued his effort to make sure that no aspect of the trip would be undocumented and told her to not just stand there, (let's get to it), Strike a pose, there's nothing to it;




Finally Mike and Suzy got in line for the Tower of Terror;




Suzy had never heard of the Tower of Terror and asked Mike what the ride was about.  Thinking that the best surprise is one that is actually a surprise, Mike told her that it was like the Haunted Mansion.  The good décor in Tower of Terror backed him up;




And Suzy got into the ride expecting a quiet non-exiting ride in which she merely watched things.  And for the first part that is what she got.  The Tower of Terror really does have some great special effects and its not surprising that Suzy thought that was the main point of the ride, right up until she dropped three stories without warning.

Suzy freaked out.  She had no idea that was coming* and when the ride dropped it really gave her a jolt.  And then they flew back up.  And dropped.  And rose.  And dropped again.  And Suzy was clutching Mike with a death grip the whole time.  Heh heh.  Mike is evil.  EVILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!

*  Well, mostly no idea.  Mike made sure her seat belt was buckled and that was a slight give away, but she really was surprised.

After their hearts got back in their throats they passed the Broom from Fantasia throwing flowers instead of water.  Disney really does have some nice horticulture;




Mike used to be really into animation, so it was a natural that hed drag Suzy along for the animation tour;




The sculpture of the Rémy from Rattattoie was really cool.  It looked like it had just popped out to the movie;




And the colors man, the colors . . . ;




There was also only a two hour wait to shake hands with a college student in a sweaty suit;




As they were walking out they passed a model of Disney Sea which Mike had never even heard of but that looked very cool;




They also caught the Little Mermaid show.  Now long, long ago, Mike remembered reading how the Little Mermaid show was actually performed under water and that the actors swam around and gulped air out of a hose.  This was not the case with this show, which was performed in the ghastly air.  Does anyone know if Mike was just hallucinating or if there really was some Little Mermaid show which was performed under water?;




On their way out to make their reservations, the happy couple passed a line of Toy Story Aliens all in a row on the street.  Why were they there?  Who put them there?  What was there purpose?  The world may never know;


"
MikeR,"As night fell it was time for Mike and Suzys second most extravagant meal of their honeymoon, dinner at Wolfgang Pucks!  The downstairs was just a tiny bit busy;




But the upstairs was definitely more romantic;


 

They were seated rather quickly and after savoring a few brief seconds of peace and quite they inaugurated what would become a truly epic night of drinking by getting a bottle of wine and toasting each other;




For those of you who are going to be keeping score, it should be considered as two drinks for Suzy and three for Mike.  (Mike  3, Suzy  2).

They got two appetizers, one of spicy tempura battered shrimp with wasabi vinaigrette, Thai sweet chili sauce, and Japanese rice.  It was divine.  Probably the best tempura that Mike has had in his life and he lived in Japan for two years;




And a appetizer of roasted beet and goat cheese layer torte with micro greens salad, toasted hazelnuts and a citrus-shallot vinaigrette.  This was good, but not nearly as good as the rest of the meal;




For the main course, Suzy ordered seared rare ahi tuna (sashimi grade) with roasted sweet peppers, braised fennel, tomatoes, capers, and black olive vinaigrette.  Suzy swears that this was the best ahi she has ever had;




And Mike got a Colorado lamb rack with black beluga lentils and tzatziki sauce.  Mike is a definite carnivore so it was exquisite to feel the meat just melt in his mouth; 




They received their customary gratis desert and Suzy wanted the picture to show off the nice lettering congratulating them, so the cake was tilted towards the camera.  And just as the picture was being taken, the cake came tumbling down;




The tasty carrot cake, though slightly marred in the lettering department, was still tasty;


"
Momof2princess,Great Trip Report....You guys look like you had an awesome time.  Can't wait to read about the rest of your trip.
MikeR,"After waddling out of the store, the couple waddled over to the Virgin Music store where they waddled around for a while.  Mike has not bought a CD in literally years, so it felt a bit like being in an actual record store, circa 1989.  The writing is on the wall and Mike just does not think stores for music are going to be around for that much longer.  When the kids are shown (edited) pictures of the honeymoon, Mike fully expects them to ask something like, You mean people actually bought music in a _store_?:




Finally it was time for Cirque de Sole!  Mike and Suzy had seen a Cirque about a year ago, but the one in Orlando was completely different.  Mike had seen it years ago, and parts of it were very familiar (he vividly remembers the Spider-Man like acrobats that climbed the wall), but others he had forgotten completely;  




Mike went and got Suzy a drink for the show, as well as two for himself (Mike  5, Suzy  3).  Like much of Cirque, you might not think ordinary circus clowns are enjoyable, but these guys were truly hilarious and even joked around with Mike and Suzy for a bit:




After the show, the two headed off to Pleasure Island;




Where they headed to Mikes favorite club in the entire world, the Adventurers Club;




Mike is not a club goer, but he _loves_ the AC and even knows a few lines of the motto by heart;




He was kind of disappointed to find out the they no longer offer any merchandise of any kind.  Mike is the proud owner of a monkey-headed drinking cup as well as a Adventurers T-shirt, but both of them are getting a little worn so he was looking to replace them, but no such luck.  Mike decided to console himself with some house drinks.  Kungaloosh!  (Mike  6, Suzy 4);




Suzy admits she is short, but she felt shorter than normal when she got caught by surprise by the shrinking stool;




One of the actors at the Adventurers Club looks a lot like a friend of Mikes.  Surely thats worthy of another drink (Mike  7, Suzy 4);




Mike and Suzy werent sure if this lady was an actor or not, so Mike went up and started talking to her and it turns out that she used to work at the AC and now just comes back for old times sake.  Even former employees love the AC!  That deserves another drink and because apparently Mike has turned into a 19-year old girl, it was at this time that he decided to start ordering Long Island Ice Teas (Mike 8, Suzy 4);




The actors at the Adventures Club are good sports and dont mind being the but of a joke;




A skit started, so Mike ordered a drink for the show (Mike - ???, Suzy - shrug) and he was especially pleased when the actors broke out into a song that Mike really enjoys and didnt know that anyone knew of, called The Future Soon;




With the last skit of the night over at the AC, Mike and Suzy stumbled out and tried to do a little dancing;




They were not under the effects of alcohol at _all_;




Nope, not even a _little_ bit;




Suzy was wanting to go home at this point, but Mike was determined to carry on and party till dawn;




That determination lasted all of about thirty seconds once they were in another dance club and Mike swayed back and forth a few times before almost loosing his footing and agreeing with Suzy that it was time to head home;





The bus ride back was . . . not pleasant, but it was only once they got to their hotel room that the nights activities really caught up with them.  They were both dog-tired, but once Mike got in bead and closed his eyes the room was exceedingly rude and decided that it would be a perfect time to start spinning and spinning and spinning.  Round and round it went until Mike sat up and stumbled to the bathroom.  In his perfectly working mind he decided that the best coarse of action would be to take a bath.  Suzy was very worried about her husband drowning as shown by how she said, Dont drown, before falling right to sleep.  Mike joined her in a half hour after the room had decided to slow down its circular motion.

Hey Mike!  How did you feel the next day?


"
MikeR,"On day six of their honeymoon Mike and Suzy were not happy campers.  They were not even gleeful hikers.  And they were far from being jubilant spelunkers.   This was due to them being hung-over honeymooners.

Come morning, they were able to walk and talk, if you generously define the terms, but they were desperately in need of some food to fill their stomachs and get their blood flowing again.    So off they trumped to the All Star Movies cafeteria.  It was surprisingly busy, but Mike soon got a hangover burger;




and Suzy got a hangover Sandwich;




Both were inimitably passable grub food of the kind you could get in any college cafeteria, but they achieved the goal of fully waking Mike and Suzy up and really what more could you ask of hangover food?

Recharged, somewhat, the couple decided to go to the Magic Kingdom.  They passed the ever present Mickey balloons;




And went to the first ride of the day, which was chosen because it was not a ride at all, but rather a theatre in which the couple could sit and not have their stomachs crashed from one side to the other.  The live animation at the Monsters Inc Joke show was pretty good, but not as entertaining and fresh as the turtle show at Epcot; 



Next was Stitchs Great Escape;




Which is also a show more than a ride.  Mike and Suzy got locked in and enjoyed watching it, but unfortunately Suzys seat did not have a functioning olfactory device and she did not get to experience the pleasure of having cheese-doodle-smelling-air being blown into her face.  She survived the depredation;




Continuing the theme of rides that are not rides, Mike and Suzy went on the Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow ride/show.  Watching the progression of daily life from 1900 to 2000 was pretty interesting, and the song is almost as catchy as Its a Small World;




At times though, it did seem as if Tomorrow Land was really showing its age.  You can really tell that its a 1950s version of what things will be like in the far off year of 2000;




Mike and Suzy went on the Wedway People Mover, which is basically a cart.  That moves.  People.  Mike remembers when he was young being absolutely fascinated by it and being sure that it was going to sweep the country and we were going to be living just like the Jetsons any day now;




This time around the only excitement to be found in the Wedway People mover was ironic excitement;




And ironic excitement just can not compete with the real thing;




Mike and Suzy were not the only ones to feel lukewarm about the People Mover, as shown by the expressions on the other tourists on the other People Mover that zoomed by Mike and Suzy at speeds of up to three miles per hour!;




After the thrills and chills of the people mover, Mike and Suzy got in the Buzz Light-year Space Ranger Zap line, which was _slightly_ longer than the line they waited in for the ever exciting People Mover;




They even received their first tracking card, which is given to tourists so Disney could figure out how long it takes to get through the line.  Mike must have asked half a dozen attendants Do I give this to you?, Ok, then do I give it to you? all to no avail.  About the only person he didnt ask this of was the person he was actually supposed to give it to!  And as a result he was buckled in and pulling away before he realized he still had the pass and had to toss it to some random attendant;




The ride itself is rather tame, but the real fun comes from the interactive parts of it; the riders get to spin the cart round and round as they try to hit various targets with their zappers;




At the end of the ride, Suzy had the higher final score;




As the loser, Mike was put in the cage and had to scream , Nooooooooooooooo!;




And then he had to do his best gorilla impression;


"
Momof2princess,"Another great two installments.   

DH and I have a night planed like yours in DTD, hopefully the morning after will not be so rough on us.  

Can't wait to read more."
Loriann70,Loving this trip report!  Keep it coming!
MikeR,"Deciding to take a more leisurely method of travel, the couple took a boat to Fort Wilderness;




The boat ride was definitely more peaceful than a bus ride, and is recommended for those wanting a bit of a break from the rush and rush nature that some vacations can become;




And it gave time for Mike to play with the more artistic settings on his camera;




When they arrived at Fort Wilderness, they marveled at how much it looked just like Oregon;




Well, except for the mini-horses, Oregon doesnt have many of those;




Or Mickey shaped golf carts;




It was at Fort Wilderness that Mike revealed Honeymoon surprise #247, a horse and carriage Ride;




After days of zooming all over the place, it was rather nice to relax and snuggle on such an old fashioned and peaceful mode of transportation.  The clomp-clomp of the horses and the rattle of the wheels quickly flowed into a steady and soothing rhythm;


"
MikeR,"After that was done, Mike and Suzy had front row seats for the Hoop De Doo Review;




The hall is quite large and themed like a Old West theatre;




And the food is served in large portions, and is typical western grub such as cornbread;




Salad;




And a truly disgusting sangria which Mike and Suzy tried one sip of and then pushed aside for the rest of the night;




The mashed potatoes, chicken, ribs, and beans were all . . . decent.  A bit like youd get in some all-you-can-eat buffet;




Now, Mike had strong memories of the strawberry shortcake at the Hoop De Doo Review being the best strawberry shortcake in the entire world and every other strawberry shortcake being a poor imitation, a mere shade, of the sublime beauty that was the Hoop De Doo Reviews Strawberry Shortcake.  It is greatly regretted that this is no longer the case.  Either they changed how they made strawberry shortcake (boo-hiss) or Mikes memory is wrong (unpossible), but regardless instead of savoring the strawberry shortcake, Mike only had a some of his.  The memory of past greatness was just too strong to make the present enjoyable;




The actors all suited their parts well, although by sitting so close to the stage Mike and Suzy got a much better look at them then would normally be the case and it can be a bit distracting to count the number of pores on someone doing a dancing jig;




The actors also really play-up their roles and arent afraid of posing for pictures on-stage;




Captain Tight-Pants had a pretty good singing-voice;




And the show really gets the audience involved, by having them stomp their feat, yell, and wave their handkerchiefs around;




As well as getting them to play a musical instrument alla Washboard-Hero;




Youve got washboard power  Use It!;




After the show Mike and Suzy went over to Down Town Disney where they made their own Mr. Potato Head;




Looked at a Lego Shark;




And caught an Improv show on Pleasure Island.  The improvers asked Mike and Suzy what they had been up to on their honeymoon, and Mike replied, Its a family show.;




Mike and Suzy were still tired from last nights activities so they didnt stay long and headed back to their hotel, briefly looking at their shadows and were happy to discover that there would be six more days of Honeymoon;


"
Momof2princess,"Washboard Hero.... good one.

Can't wait to read the next installment."
MikeR,"Mike and Suzy were a little unsure if they wanted to do another Character Meal, but the reservations had already been made so the two departed for the Princess Storybook Breakfast at the Akershus Royal Banquet Hall in World Showcase.  

They were greeted at the door by Belle who was kind enough to formally dress up for the occasion, thereby making Mike and Suzy look like the slobs they are:




Once inside the décor proved to be up to the usual Disney standard:




Mike had never had Norwegian food before so he was curious to give it a try.  There was an  appetizer bar before the main meal that provided many dishes, but nothing that Mike had never tried before, although the cheeses were very tasty:




Suzy got a pretty standard meat and potatoes dish;




While Mike asked the waiter for the most Norwegian item on the menu and got a Traditional Kjottkaker which has cauliflower, garlic, cheese infused mashed potato, and a beet sauce.  Mike is not in love with Norwegian food and will probably not have it again, but he is glad that he got to give it a try;




The couple also received yet another complimentary desert tray.  Disney obviously has some fiendish plot to try and get the couple to be too big to fit on the airplane home, thereby forcing them to stay in the parks forever;




In between stuffing their faces with meats and vegetables cooked by a people who think fermented trout is the height of culinary excellence, various Princess came by and introduced themselves to Mike and Suzy.  They were all very nice and complimentary to the Honeymooners and congratulated the duo profusely.  Here is Suzy with Ariel:




Mike with Aurora;




Pocahontas was showing off her goods . . . by which the author means her necklace  . . . no . . .  no, he doesnt;




And here is Mike trying to strike an Aladdin-like pose with Jasmine;


"
MikeR,"Once outside the couple took a look around the pavilion and enjoyed the illusion of being in a Norwegian town;




They hopped aboard the Norwegian ride which was scary when you are 9, but is just goofy at 29;




In the obligatory gift-shop the couple mulled over buying a troll or getting a new roof for the same price. . . buying a troll or getting a new roof . . . hmm . . . decisions, decisions:




Suzy also contemplated the advantages in switching to a career in the lucrative field of viking;




Thanks to the wonderful world of Disney geography, China is just a hop a skip and a pirouette from Norway; 

;

The China pavilion has a most interesting tree.  Does anyone know what type of tree this is?




Here is a picture of Mulan by herself because apparently she was too good to demean herself by standing next to the commoners;




Mike had seen the Terra-cotta stone soldiers at a museum before, but the exhibit on them was still fascinating;




Mike would like to get this Chinese saying over his desk at work;




While waiting for the Circle Vision movie on China to start, there was a brief performance of a classical Chinese instrument.  It was very soothing and a nice break from the hectic zoom zoom zoom of the vacation.  Does anyone know what this instrument is called?




The movie about China was really well done, perhaps the best movie Mike and Suzy saw at Disney World.  In a 360 degree theatre, the audience is shown a panoramic view of the glories of China.  It really captures the thousands of years of history and culture that China has had as well as its vast natural world from the deserts to jungle to plains.  So of course after watching such a powerful movie Mike and Suzy put on silly hats;




Mike and Suzy went to see the 2:15 ritual human sacrifice at the Aztec pyramid in the Mexico pavilion, because Disney is always historically accurate, but for some reason the show never began;




They consoled themselves by taking a picture in front of lake;


"
MikeR,"Having enough of World Showcase, the couple headed to future!  Their first stop was Test Track, where guests explore the strange new world that will come about when horseless carriages become cheap enough that a workingman can buy one for only three years worth of wages!  The Test Track ride was . . . a bit disappointing.  Mike and Suzy have both been driving for over a decade now, and they have both driven in some extreme circumstances and nothing that Test Track did was actually more exciting than what they have done in real life;




As consolation Disney apologized and invited the couple to enjoy looking at funky plants;




Next up was Mission Space - an interactive centrifuge ride.  Mike had never been on this before and knew nothing about it, so it was a treat to go into a ride almost completely ignorant of what it would entail.  The G-forces are a hoot, and just strong enough that they are fun and not sickening (although Mike and Suzy were a bit dizzy for a while afterwards).  Mike was tempted to purposely fail his part of the interaction to see what would happen, but in the end he pushed the button at the right time and saved the mission.  Yay for Mike:




The couple also caught a showing of The Circle of Life.  Now, Suzy is a chemical engineer so this show kind of ticked her off with its anti-civilization theme.  It makes a point about how horrible making trash is, but how much garbage does Disney World produce in just one day?  Sure they may recycle as much as they can, but were still talking about landfills after landfills worth of trash.  The film is just a rather smug and sanctimonious flick about how bad the modern world is, more or less, and it just feels out of place at Disney World which, when you get down to, is pretty much a celebration of consumerism;




Wanting to cleanse their pallet, Mike and Suzy caught the new Imagination ride.  Mike didnt think it was as good as the old one, and he is 10% sure that is not the result of nostalgia.  The whole time the ride was going on he was humming the South Park Imagination song to himself;




As punishment for that a blowfish tried to eat his brain to cleanse any reference of South Park from the pristine Disney environment;




The day was growing long, so the couple leisurely headed for the next event that Mike had planned, a couples massage at the Spa & Health Club at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa.  Once they arrived at the Grand Floridian, they had a bit of a trouble finding it, but when they did it was great.  Mike and Suzy were having a fabulous time on their honeymoon, but it could be rather hectic and busy at times.  The massage was a great change of pace.  It was also probably about four or five times as expensive as a similar massage would be at home, but they didnt need a relaxing massage when they were home, they needed one on their honeymoon so that is when they got it.  Mike thought that the couples massage would be, you know, a massage together . . .  as a couple, but such was not the case.  They were both put in different rooms and really didnt interact any during the massage, so the couples part was really just a marketing ploy, but it was still a great and relaxing break;




Freshly invigorated, Mike and Suzy got back to their room and laid down.  Dont they look oh so very sleepy?;

DisneyJo,"Had to come and read your TR after reading your hilarious food review and this is even more hilarious, I love your writing style "
DISNEYmooner2008,Joining in on the fun!! We also honeymooned at Disney and had a great time!
Momof2princess,"As always great installment 

Keep them coming."
krismom,Congratulations and great report! I'm off to find the dining one now...
hjohnson6,Great trip report!  I can't wait for the rest of the installments.
MikeR,"The next day Mike and Suzy went to the Magic Kingdom for the Keys to the Kingdom tour  a long backstage tour on just how the Magic Kingdom operates.  As Suzy is an engineer, Mike thought she might find it interesting.  Here she is waiting for the guided tour to start:





After the standard sit-around-and-wait-and-people-watch-while-other-people-are-people-watching-you, the tour group congealed like Jell-O in a luke warm fridge and a dozen or so tourists headed down Main Street, listening to a guide explain how the magic came about i.e., how Disney removes its garbage without any guests seeing it (pneumatic tubes);




The guide was . . . not that good to tell the truth.  In theory a backstage tour of the Magic Kingdom could be a lot of fun, but it really depends on who your guide is.  To make it interesting you need a guide who is lively, can tell interesting stories in an entertaining manner, and can shepherd crowds like a border collie.  Mike and Suzys guy just wasnt up to snuff.  He pointed out some interesting things, like the meaning behind the names on the shop windows;




But he didnt have a very exciting or lively personality, and that really makes or breaks these things.  There were some fun parts of the tour, such as when they went backstage and got to see the actors preparing to go out and perform Woodies Round-Up.  They really have to work out and stretch because its a rather physically demanding job;




After taking a backstage tour through the Jungle Cruise, Mike and Suzy, as part of their Keys to the Kingdom Tour got a free lunch at the Harbor House;




The sandwich was, and everyone say this with me, just a sandwich.  Like any you could get in a million other places.  Mike and Suzy split it because they wanted to have an empty stomach for their big meal that night;




Suzy also got a salad which was shockingly, just a salad;




The food was so-so, and at this point Mike and Suzy decided to just give up on the tour.  It wasnt worth there time, so they made some polite excuse to the tour guide, and wrote the whole thing off as a bust;




Looking for things to do, the duo decided to check out the Enchanted Tiki-Tiki-Tiki Room, where the bird sing songs and the flowers croon.  Neither Mike nor Suzy have adult memories of the original Tiki Room, so they cant comment on the changes, but it was a quick entrance and an amusing few minutes of fun;




Afterwards the couple was _tired_.  They had been zooming all over the place for a solid week at this point, and did not get a good nights rest the night before.  So when they hopped on the boat ride that they thought was going to take them to Tom Sawyer Island but instead just floated them around the park in a very lazy manner, Suzy fell asleep for a bit;




After she woke up, Mike took her to that most exciting of all Disney rides, the Hall of Presidents;




Back in the day, the line for the Hall of Presidents used to be as long as Space Mountain is today, but Mike and Suzy just walked in.  Despite the dated animatronics it is still a hoot for a history buff to see those fellows get up and talk;


"
MikeR,"Continuing the trend of nonstop, don't-wanna-miss action blowout fun Mike and Suzy went to the Swiss Family Robinson Tree house;




When Mike was a kid he used to wish that he was shipwrecked.  Now as an adult he wishes he was shipwrecked . . . on an island with a nice hotel and good wi-fi; 




When Mike was a young tike he went with his friend Zach to Disneyland.  They were having a Sword in he Stone celebration and were asking for volunteers to try and remove the sword.  Mike, trying to be a good boy, oh-so-patiently and politely raised his hand and kept quite.  Zach on the other hand, jumped up and down and yelled, “Pick me!  Pick me!”  They picked Zach and Zach got to be “King of Disneyland” for the day.  Seriously.  The dude got his photo taken and everything and kept it in his room like a shrine for a decade.  Not that Mike is bitter.  So, when Mike saw the sword just sticking out, he had to give it a try to see if he could be King of Disney World

Ugh.  It’s a tough sword;




Almost there;




So close . . . ;




One more yank: 




Ah, forget it.  That sword is not going anywhere.  Mike decided to try something a little less intense, like going to Pooh’s House.  Mike wasn’t really that into Pooh until he was a teacher in Japan for a few years.  Pooh is HUGE in Japan, and his students fondness for the little bear rubbed off on Mike:




There was some very yummy honey to eat there too;




Since they visited Pooh’s house, it was only fair to check out Mickey’s House.   It wasn’t as cool as Pooh’s Corner, because lets face it, Mickey just isn’t as interesting a character as Pooh.  But one fun moment came when Mike and Suzy spotted some books in the far corner, but couldn’t read what the title was.  Mike then used his new digital camera to take a picture, then zoomed in on that picture to read what the title was.  Their grandkids will probably ask why they didn’t just use a holographic data collector, but for now Mike and Suzy still get a kick out of our clunky 2008 tech;




Speaking of clunky tech, it is doubtful that we will every romanticize our current technology like the way we have that of the steam age.  Mike and Suzy caught the train back to the exit from the park and it was just as crowded as ever.  There is just something that kids love about trains;




Even if those trains do prohibit people from doing any crazy dancing;




Mike and Suzy then went to a workout.  Yes, really.  They try to get regular workouts at home, and even though they had done a lot of walking, they had yet to really break a sweat on the trip so they used the spa at The Grand Floridian to get in a quick workout before dinner, all the better to spur their appetites;




Afterwards they showered and putt on their fancy clothes;




Because it was time for one of the highlights of their vacation, dinner with wine pairing at the Chef’s table at Victoria and Albert’s!;


"
hjohnson6,I am looking forward to hearing about Victoria and Albert's.
DisneyJo,What a shame about the tour and you not pulling the sword out 
pooh'smate,Loving your tr so far. Can't wait to hear about V&A. Now I am off to find your food reveiw.
OhMari,"I'm trying to decide if Victoria and Alberts is worth it, please come back and finish."
MikeR,"Way back in the Honeymoon phase Mike did extensive research on what the happy couple would be doing in Disney World and in his reading he came across a little dive restaurant called Victoria and Alberts.  There was the regular V&A experience which merely required calling a mere three months ahead of time to get a reservation, or there was the insanely expensive Chefs Table which could best be reserved by having signed letters of recommendations from the President, the Pope, and two of the top five Primordial Forces of the Universe.  Without those one would have to do what Mike did, get your patootie up at 3:53 in the damn morning and push a zillion buttons to try and be the first caller of the day so that one could get the 1 (one) spot they had for that day.

The first day Mike tried this he didnt get it.

The second day Mike tried to do this he still didnt get it, although he got better at the button pushing.

Third day, ditto.

Fourth day, same.

Fifth day, same and he was getting really cranky at having to wake up so early.  That night he said to Suzy that he wasnt sure if he should continue trying or not, and maybe they could do something else.  Suzy said that if Mike didnt at least continue to _try_ hed regret it.  Maybe not that day, and maybe not the next, but come the vacation hed wish he had tried one more day to get the reservation.

So Mike got his *** up one more time, and he got the reservation!  Ah victory . . . thy name is reservation!

Now, Mike had long since ditched MickeyDs as a choice of sustenance, and has been slowly developing a more complex and refined (I.E. expensive) pallet over the last two or three years, but he had never gone to a meal as extravagant as Victoria and Alberts Chefs Table with Wine paring..  

As soon as you walk through the entrance to Victoria and Alberts, you know you are in a classy joint.  Another way you know that you are in a classy joint is that if you refer to it as a classy joint while there, then people will look at you as if you were something they scrapped off of their shoe;




The main chef was not in that day, so Mike and Suzy were shown around by the assistant chef.  He was a nice guy and did a great job at explaining all the dishes and making the dining experience even more special;




First up was the bread and butter of the meal, literally;




The bread had the perfect mix of crunchy outer layer and soft inside while the butter was so rich and creamy that you wanted to go out personally thank the cow that produced it;




The first course was a selection of Amuse Bouche, Smoked Duck Under the Glass, Celery Breleee and Parsley Root, Deviled Quail Egg with Tsar Nicolai Caviar, with a wine paring of Heisieck Monopole Blue Top Brut Champagne NV;




Looking back on that dish the memory of how it tasted can best be brought forth by chanting nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom-nom!

It was also pretty interesting to what the cooks making all the meals for ourselves and the other patrons.  No on seemed to have any talented rats underneath their hats though;


"
k_reile,wow...it would be really cool to eat there...but I am soo picky that I do not think they would want to make me chicken fingers...   so I guess V&A is out for DH and I. Our wallets will probably thank us
MikeR,"Let us talk about wine for a bit;




One can buy a bottle of Two-Buck-Chuck and chug it out of an old jam jar while munching on a bugger from Fuddruckers and that is a wine paring only in the same sense that a chicken is a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

What Victoria and Alberts does with matching wine with food is difficult to describe, which makes the job of describing it rather difficult (funny that).  Each course is well-thought out and perfectly harmonized with a wine that compliments the dish while not overpowering it. 





And really, what more could one want from a wine?  Other than to get a good buzz going down, another thing which these wines excelled at by the way. 

The dishes, like the Chorizo Crusted Gulf Shrimp with Garbanzo Beans, Albequina Olives and Banyuls Vinaigrette with wine paring of Cantina Del Taburno Falanghina, Campania 2005, are all fondly remembered in the abstract from this gastronomical vacation from a vacation;





Yet describing a meal that one had four months ago is rather difficult.  Does the memory of taste really last in the same way that the memory of sight or sound does?  Can you really recall a great meal in the same way you recall a great game you played in or a great concert you heard?  Is it just that we are trained to remember our other senses more than taste, or is it some biological factor?  If someone says that they had Monterey Abalone with toasted capers and mey lemon Alaskan stablefish with petite French lentils, winter corn and saffron foam with wine paring of Frank Family Vineyards Chardonnay, Napa Valley 2005;





Does that draw forth memories in the same way that describing a lone beach at midnight on a summer night in which a solitary owl can be heard hooting in the distance?  And how many questions can a foodie post pose anyways? 

But while the questions may stop coming the courses at V&A never seemed to.  The waiters expertly delivered dish after dish to the happy couple;





Who ate them all with relish.  A multi-course meal is very different from more traditional meals.  The food arrives in a slow steady stream rather than in a giant log.  This allows you more time to savor and enjoy the experience and talk between courses.  Much like the exact taste of the food (other than it was good) the specifics of the conversation also remain out of reach, yet fondly remembered.

Both the Ballotine of Pulet Rouge with Chicken Consomme, Scottish Chanterelles and black truffles with wine paring of Pere Fils Christian Moreau Chablis 2004.





and the Kurobuta Pork Tenderloin and Belly with Banana Squash Ragout, 100 Year Balsamic with wine paring of Carol Shelton Rocky Reserve Zinfandel, Dry Crekk Valley 2004





made the mouth experience flavors that fail at being adequately being put into words.

Now the next dish may be a little controversial as it was Pan Roasted Foie Gras with Fuji Apples and Mostarda did Cremona with Royal Tokaji Azsu 5 Puttonyos, Mad Tokaj-Hegyalja 2003.





Now Mike had heard horror stories about how Foie Gras is made, but before he went to his honeymoon he actually saw a documentary on how the ducks are fed, and how the composition of their necks makes it so that it is not as uncomfortable for them to be fed in that manner as one might suppose.

And Foie Gras tastes sooooooooooooooo good.  So very very good.

The tasting of the Japanese Wagyu Strip Loin and Australian Kobe Tenderloin with Oxtail Jus with wine paring of Beaulie Vineyard Tapestry Reserve, Napa 2004 went very well and the beef just melted in their mouths;





Mike had some small worry that the various meats would not mix well in the stomach, but this proved not to be a problem. 

The Fourme DAmbert Cheese and Fondue, 4 Year Aged Gouda and St. Marcellin was fantastically rich and succulent;





Suzy started to get a little chilly so she began bundling up before the chilly desert courses;





Which consisted of Wild Strawberry Sorbet, Mango-Yogurt Panna Cotta and Miniature Banana Gateau with wine paring of Paolo Saracco Moscato DAsti, Piedmont 2006.





As well as the Tanzanian Chocolate Pyramid, Hawaiian Kona Chocolate Soufflé and Peruvian Chocolate Ice Cream and Puff Pastry





Which was followed by the exciting act of the Celebes Coffee brewing, a type of brewing the Suzy had never seen before and as an engineer she had lots of questions to ask about it;





For Mike it was enough that it produced a cup of coffee, and that was all he needed to know.  He was not and is not a big coffee fan, but he drank most of his cup for the experience of it, and also because he could probably have used a caffeine jolt by then;




The two did drink a fair amount that night;



But Mike still had time to play with his camera settings;




As the night wore to a close the happy couple was presented with chocolate candy treats and a polite invitation to vacate the premises as they and one waiter were the only ones left, all other cooks and patrons having departed;




As Mike left the facilities he happened to notice a tray of booze just sitting in the hallway and also noticed the curious fact that no one else around.  But he most certainly did not get a nightcap from it of Pearl Brandy before leaving.  Because that would have been wrong;




Total cost for the nights dinner?  A lot.  The tip alone was more than Mike has often spent for a nice dinner and lets just leave it at that.  Weeks later Mike would talk about the dinner with his Dad and not only was it the most expensive dinner Mike had ever had, but it was also more expensive than any dinner his Dad had had, and his Dad is not a poor man. 

But was it worth it?  On the whole, yes, in that it was their honeymoon and it was nice to get all dressed up for a grand and memorable dinner, but they are unlikely to do anything like that again for a long time.

And of course it can be considered all worth it when Suzy thanked Mike for the lovely dinner;




The happy couple took the monorail home;




Said goodnight to their blanket-animal pal, and went to sleep because they had another busy day tomorrow;


"
MikeR,"If you were to have an eight course meal paired with eight glasses of wine, what would be the event you want to do the next day?  Why, take surfing lessons before the sun had rose of course!  Mike and Suzy were going to follow this brilliant plan out of need, not desire.  Because it just happened that the only day they could do the Chefs table at V&A was followed by the only day they could take surfing lessons at Typhoon Lagoon.  They hemmed and hawed but decided that they might as well seize every moment of their honeymoon, so this day found them dragging themselves very slowly out of bed and making their way to Typhoon Lagoon in the early morning;





They had been a little worried about the weather as it was cold for the first days of the new year, but luckily for the honeymooners it warmed up rather nicely.  Their was a brief wait at TL, but eventually the instructors arrived and let Mike and Suzy, as well as the others in the group, into the park a few hours before opening.  The group was going to have the worlds largest wave pool to themselves for a few hours to learn how to surf;





Now surfing is not an easy sport.  You might think, Oh, all it is, is paddling forward while pushing a heaving wooden board in time with a wave of water that has a random amount of force behind it, and then standing up on that board while keeping the correct balance necessary to stand on water, how hard can that be?  Very hard.  Extremely hard.  Putting a camel through the needle of a pin while the camel is doing the Macarena hard.  

Mike had tried it while in Japan.  He was in a perfect spot with a good board and he tried to catch wave after wave after wave.  He did not succeed.  He did, however, get exceptionally sun-burned.  So that was a nice consolation.  

The surfing lessons at TL make it somewhat easier in that the waves are regularly timed and have a regular amount of force behind them.  This makes standing on a board on a body of water that is moving a slightly easier task.  

The instructors gave us a number of good tips.  They were just basic instructions, but you really cant expect too detailed advice when you are with a group of people.  

The last time Mike went surfing he never even waxed the board.  He doesnt know if that would have made any difference or not, but at least it was something to do while waiting in line for a wave.







Eventually it was go time, and go they did.  Suzy did an excellent job of catching her first wave and trying to stand up;




When it was Mikes turn he did better on his first try then he ever did out on the real ocean.  He didnt fully stand up, but he came close;




You have to paddle back after you first wave to catch your second wave, oh the horrors one puts up with on vacation; 




Suzy stood up!  She was literally surfing for a bit!  Mike was so proud of her.




Of course, there is no glory without the risk of defeat, and both Mike and Suzy had many a wipeout that day;




But Mike got up to!  He was fully riding the waves for a bit.  Granted he later biffed it and crashed into the water, but for a moment he was standing tall.  Woot!;




After a few waves the personal lesson was over and Mike and Suzy had to leave the park because it was time to go back into the park because they wanted to explore everything it had to offer;




Now Typhoon Lagoon is a great water park.  Like all of the Disney parks, it has a theme to it, mainly that a big old typhoon splashed over a lagoon (see the clever naming scheme now?) and resulted in everything becoming topsy turvey.  




And Mike and Suzy got Free Mickey Hats!  Now Mickey Hats are of limited use when one is in a water park, getting wet, but it was the only thing they received from the Dream Teams that wonder around giving free stuff, so it was kind of cool;




Besides the largest wave pool in the world, the most attractive  part of Typhoon Lagoon is probably the ridiculously steep water rides which feel as if you are falling at a 90 degree angle;




After doing all the exciting rides (which really didnt take that long, Mike and Suzy decided to relax a while on the Lazy River and just soak up some sun for a while;




It was crowded at times which kind of detracted from its relaxing atmosphere, but still not a bad bit or relaxation;


"
DisneyJo,"The surfing looked great fun and you both stood up, that was fantastic 

I've never heard of the dream team at a waterpark, those ears must have got soaked "
LovintheLodge,Yeah!  Back for another installment.  I have really enjoyed your trip report...love your writing style! 
MikeR,"As the noon day sun beat down upon their backs, Mike and Suzy decided that it was time to get away from the cool refreshing water park and go tramp around under the baking sun in the largest park in DW, Animal Kingdom;





They had just enough time to take pictures of a few strange plants;




And animals; 




and interesting fossils;




Wasn't Disney lucky that so many animals and creatures were fossilized where they decided to build their park?

They also had time for ""It's Tough to be a Bug!""




Which was a pretty darn good 3-D experience.  When Mike first saw it many years ago, he had no idea of the various surprises that the show springs on you.  When the animatronics came on he was blown away.  When the ""acid"" was sprayed he was blown again.  And when the bugs crawled under his but, again he was blown.  

Watching it again didn't have quite the same experience, but was still enjoyable.  It still might be the best 3-D show at DW.

Mike and Suzy left earlier than they needed to because they didn't know the travel times to get from the Animal Kingdom to the Animal Kingdom Lodge;




They arrived a little early but that was OK as it gave them time to check out some of the attractions at the lodge;





If you've got to kill time waiting for a reservation, there are definitely worse places to do it than the AKL;




Heck, even the waiting tables were pretty spiffy;




Finally it was time for Boma;




The staff was helpful; 




and very friendly;




and quickly showed the newlyweds to their seats;




The menu was very intriguing.  Mike loves to explore when he is dining and does not have that much experience with African food so other than Victoria and Albert's, Boma was probably the place he was most excited about eating at;




A quick rundown of the menu;

shows that their was much food to explore;




and;




explore;




they;




did;




And of course they got their customary free honeymoon desert;




It has been over half a year since Mike last ate at Boma, so remember any specific likes and dislike is rather difficult for him.  He remembers being very pleased with the overall experience and devouring a number of dishes, but he can not recommend any exact ones.  So try them all!"
MikeR,"After a night at Boma the couple wasn't very hungry.  They just got a standard breakfast at the standard All-Star cafeteria, and after standing in a standard line, the standard breakfast was standard;




Then off to Animal Kingdom, home of the big wooden fort;




Animal Kingdom is by far the most beautiful park.  Everything is surrounded by such a lush greenness that one can forget that there are 20,000 other people walking around trying to soak up the lush greenness.  There is really no park in Disney World that one can go to in order to relax, but Animal Kingdom probably comes the closest.  Mike really enjoyed the various strange flora and fauna.  He can't even get a blueberry bush to grow in his front yard without strange brown spots appearing on the leaves slightly before the bush explodes and shrivels into a raisin sized ball.  Disney on the other hand; 



They can transport trees that appear to be from the Planet Zaxon-Five and gets them to grow in a climate that could be described as Tropical  With Occasional Freeze Spells On Your Fricken Honeymoon, and not only grow but thrive;




One of the great things about AK is that much of it is more like a zoo than an amusement park.  There are many different animals which you can just look at for a while without having to wait in line for.  One of animals the Happy Honeymooners came across was a meerkat, which failed to dress in drag and do the hula;




Given that the couple had walked five minutes and hadn't eaten in almost an hour, it was time for a snack.  You know, when you think about it, eating a Mickey shaped food is a little weird.  Your symbolically eating an anthropomorphisized rodent.  Perhaps it wouldn't have seemed so weird if Mike hadn't screamed, ""I'm eating your head Mickey!  Resistance is futile, I will consume you and you will provide nourishment for me!  Mwa-ha-ha!""




AK is a pretty big place, with tons of places to explore and wander.  Here are Mike and Suzy on a path to nowhere, or possibly adventure;




Kilimanjaro Safaris was probably the best part of AK.  Reality is just plain cool, and while the animals are not in their natural environment, they are still read living breathing animals and to have them so close that your tour is held up for a wildebeest crossing is spiffy keen;




Let alone being held up for a rhino crossing, which is super-extra-spiffy-keen;




There were also plenty of colorful side acts to watch as you were walking from one ride to the next, like this jumping act.  If the African nation this troop is from is ever invaded by an alien race of hoops that can only be defeated by jumping through them at increasing speeds, who-boy, those aliens are _doomed_;




When Mike and Suzy went to Expedition Everest they had the toughest decision of their honeymoon so far, weather to go in the singles line or not.  The singles line was about 1/4th as long and moved twice as fast, so if the math is right then that means that they would arrive in San Diego at 11:35 PM on train B.  But taking the singles line would mean that they would be separated for a whole two minutes, possibly even three, which in Honeymoon times roughly translated to three weeks of normal married couple time.  In the end, they did split up and went in separate rides.  Mike avoided shouting/singing ""Near, Far, Wherever you are, I believe that the heart does go onnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!"" by the slimmest of margins.  



Overall the ride was pretty fun.  It was a roller coaster ride.  It went fast.  There was nice stuff to look at it.  If it had been ridden earlier in the vacation it might have wowed them more, but they were beginning to be a little ridded out by now;




Ridded out!  How could it be!  Perhaps they just hadn't gone on the right rides yet.  Yea, that was the ticket.  The couple knew that they really wouldn't get hurt on any of the rides so their was no element of danger.  They needed some risk, or some thrill, or some chance that things wouldn't go as planned.  Hmmm . . . they had an activity to do in about and hour and a half, and it would be really bad if they arrived to it soaking wet, so yea, they should go on the Kali River Rapids and put their faith in the gods that they would not get wet!  That would be a smart move.

So that is what they did.  The couple kept exchanging nervous glances at each other as they passed people who looked like they had just got out of a shower that they for some reason took with their clothes on, and when they passed a sign that said, ""You will get wet, you may get soaked,"" they came close to turning around, but almost close only counts in horseshoes and thermonuclear weapons so they got on the ride.

They buckled in with two other couples.  Round and round the tube went, spinning like a roulette wheel to determine who would get soaked and who would merely get splashed.  Big drop 1  couple to their left got soaked.  Big drop 2  couple to their right got soaked.  And on and on it went.  Every time Mike and Suzy thought they were about to get soaked they merely got sprayed and some other couple got the brunt of the water.

At the end of the ride they were wet, but nothing that couldn't get dried off in an hour and a half.  Everyone else in their tube was absolutely drenched though.  Sometimes the bread lands butter-side up.




In celebration of their victory over water, it was time for a ceremonial devouring of a turkey leg.  Now, last time Mike was in Disney World (at the turn of the century) he was a little puzzled why all these people were just walking around with big slabs of meat on bones munching on it like they were Fred Flintstone.   Yet by the end of the trip, he really wanted to get one, but time and chance proved too much for the lad and no turkey leg was had.

But this trip, oh this trip he was determined to taste turkey-flesh!  And taste it he did.  He savored it, and munched it, and gobbled (gobbled, get it?  Get it?) it;




And once the Turkey was defeated he raised it and shouted ""Victory!"" like he was Johnny Drama;


"
MikeR,"Sometimes when you are on vacation you get so wrapped up in doing things and ""having fun"" that you stop having fun because you are trying so hard to ""have fun.""  When you feel yourself in that situation sometimes it is best to just stop and relax for a while;

And that's what Mike and Suzy did.  They had a nice nap in the shade on a sunny faux-beach.   





After refreshing themselves with precious precious slumber, the happy honeymooners went to engage in an activity that is almost a sport, golf!





Suzy had been to a driving range and a putting course (one without windmills) before, but she had never played an actual game of golf before so it was up to this guy to teach her;





Doesn't that face just fill one with confidence?  Isn't that the guy you'd want to be driving around what is an essentially oversized go-cart with walls at the highest speed it would go?





Especially given that he was partaking of some adult liquid refreshments at the local snack shack before starting;





Mike began his lesson by giving her a brief history of Golf.  Golf is a game that is almost 40 years old!  It was begun by a group of Japanese soldiers on a remote pacific island who never learned that WWII ended.  These poor guys had nothing to do on their tropic island but hunt wild geckos for their dinner.  While doing so, one spotted a group of albino geckos and swung at them with a stick.  He brought back his prey and when his companions asked how many he got, he said, ""Four""  Thus the sport of golf was born.

It's come a long way since then, and who knows where it will go in the future?  Perhaps someday men will even shoot golf balls into a sand trap shaped like Mickey Mouse.  But that day is many years away;





Suzy whiffed a couple of times at her first shot, but she eventually made contact with the ball (woo-hoo!) and the couple slowly advanced down the course.  At the second hole, a group of around fore players showed up and said they were trying to get in one last round.  Mike told them to go ahead and play through, but they said that since there were four of them, they didn't feel right in doing so.  Mike explained that he had chosen this time so that they would be the very last people to play because this was his wife's first time out.  Before the final syllable had left Mike's mouth, the foursome sprinted up to the green to get ahead of the happy couple.

The game progressed slowly after that.  Mike has played golf a couple of times, but isn't very skilled at it.  But it was a fun exploratory game.  One advice to any golf balls out there who happen to be reading this.  

If this man comes up to hit you;





Fly straight and true or the next time he will hit you so hard that _this_ will happen to you;






And if you are a golfer, beware of this lake for it has a monstrous appetite for balls that can be satiated;





The happy couple played about five holes of golf and then were played out.  It was getting dark, and they had had their fill.   It wasn't that they didn't have fun doing it, but five holes was enough and the point of a vacation is to relax and have fun, not to feel like you have to do something.

After golf, Mike and Suzy ran to Epcot to grab dinner at Teppan Edo.  They had time to spare so they got in a quick ride at the Spaceship Earth, which turned into a long ride as their speaker was broken so at the end of the ride they got put in a cart and did it all over again.  Watching the scenery with no background music or explanations was a bit of a bizarre experience.  It was like being shanghaied by a drunk time traveler who kept showing you slideshows of his vacation without any explanation of what they were or why you should care;



 

Afterwards there was a very cool interactive game where you push around circles of light to various cities to generate more and more power.  Mike and Suzy watched another couple, and figured out that team work was the key.  They did pretty good and it was a lot of fun, but even after two tries they couldn't get the top spot;





Watching the fountains at night was also a nice little treat;




As was the obligatory alcoholic slushy;




Finally it was dinner time.  Mike and Suzy's chef was very helpful and friendly;





And performed all the usual tricks of a hibachi restaurant;





Mike and Suzy's meal was good overall.  They had . . . . er . . . um . . . hibachi food!  Well what do you expect?  This trip report is being written almost a year after the trip.  The author can't remember what they had really, but the food was pretty standard hibachi food.  If you've ate at Benihana's you've eaten at Teppan Edo.

At least the couple got their, by now, obligatory free desert;





And now, your moment of Zen;

MikeR,"Day 11:  No Camera, Miniature Golf

Mike and Suzy had another nice lazy breakfast in bed with bacon, sausage and waffles of Mickey's face covered in strawberries; 







The breakfast was so lazy and Mike and Suzy had gotten so many carbs over the vacation that it was not until they were on the bus that they realized the unspeakable had happened; Mike had forgotten his camera.  There would exist a day of their honeymoon that was not documented in excruciating detail.  So please accept these stole^^^^^ borrowed pictures from elsewhere on the net.

The first activity of the happy honeymooners was a round of miniature golf at the Fantasia mini-golf yard.





It was a lot of fun, and the courses were difficult yet still enjoyable.  The surroundings were pretty whimsical.  





It should be noted that Suzy beat Mike, and that this was her first time playing miniature golf in a number of years.  It should be noted because Suzy noted this quite frequently throughout the rest of the day.

Mike and Suzy debated whether they should play a second round or not, but in the end decided to give the Fantasia Fairway a shot.  This second course was extremely difficult.  It was set up so that each round looked like that of a regular golf course, only miniaturized.  For some reason this made it extremely challenging to play and both Mike and Suzy sweated to get under six strokes on most holes;.





After such a grueling ordeal the only thing that could relieve their suffering would be a trip to Epcot to finish their around the world of drinking.  Unfortunately, no record exists of what exactly they drank during their final round of drunkitude, as Mike had forgotten their camera, so let us assume that it was something fruity and slushy like;




They also fast-passed Soaring;  





Which was OK, and checked out Universe of Energy;  





Which they found pretty lame.  Feeling rided out, the two went and Saw Charlie Wilson's War, which was a pretty interesting movie.  Afterwards they grabbed sushi and pizza at Wolfgang Puck's express;  





and talked about the moral implications of arming the Taliban in a Cold War context.  Woo-hoo!  What a rockin honeymoon!

Then it was time for one final trip to Pleasure Island, to watch one final show at the Adventure's Club;  





And as luck would have it, as they were walking down the streets, Mike and Suzy heard the song that they first danced to on their wedding night.  They took hold of each other and danced in the street while it was playing.  A lovely end to another wonderful day, even if it did remain undocumented."
MikeR,"Day 12:  Chef De France, Disney Quest, Leaving

Mike and Suzy woke up on their last day to great a wonderful sunny Florida morning.  They took one last picture of Suzy on an ""S"" (S for Suzy, which Mike did not get until it was laboriously explained to him);





and went to the Boardwalk to have a quick stroll





taking in as much sun as they could before going back to rainy old Oregon.  When they arrived at the entrance t Epcot, where Mike had reservations for Chefs de France, their pass was turned down because they had used up all of their days.  Mike counted on his fingers, then took off his shoes and counted on his toes, and he had thought that he still had one day left, but it turned out that he had forgotten one day.  They used the good old, ""But it's our honeymoon!"" and managed to get a quick one hour pass to go inside and have a short lunch.





As he was in a French restaurant, Mike felt compelled to order escargot, which he actually likes;





Suzy, however, thought it tasted like rubber bands soaked in butter, and went with the chicken filled crepes and Mike got the Quiche Lorraine;





The crepe sauce was a little too bland, and the quiche tasted dry.  Both were adequate, but not really great.  

After the meal the happy honeymooners left Epcot at a brisk walk and decided to check out Disney Quest, the most Uber-Arcade that ever Ubered, with their last few hours of their honeymoon;





The most fun their game was probably Astroblasters;





Mike and Suzy drove around in a little cart that sucked up these foam balls, which you then had to load and shoot at other players.  When you get hit, you spin round round round, like a record baby right right round round;





Suzy was an excellent loader;





And the duo did a great job at shooting five year olds and making them cry.

There was also a cool pirate game where Mike and Suzy sunk some pirate ships;





A fun rafting game where Mike and Suzy tried to out paddle a pterodactyl, and game where they flew Aladdin's Magic Carpet by looking like a total dork;





Time passed as it is want to do, and after posing for one last picture together;





Mike and Suzy caught their last monorail;





and flew home.  It was a long plane ride, but they arrived safe and sound with all their luggage and a lot of memories;





It was honestly time for the honeymoon to come to a close.  They had enjoyed their time at Disney World, but by the end they were rided out and had done everything there they wanted to do.  Every honeymoon has to end, and the two were ready to begin their new life together.

It was a great honeymoon, but it was time for the really fun time to begin where together, Mike and Suzy would get to live happily ever after.

The End."
